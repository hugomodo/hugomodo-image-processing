# This could be a comma-delimited string as below, or an array of values.
# Importantly, theme breakpoints need to be known so this will be per-theme configuration.
# sizes = "(min-width: 800px) 50vw, 100vw"
#
# These should also be configurable per-instance of imgproc.
# minSize could be useful should we add additional lower values, for instance for small avatars.
# maxSize will prevent the addition of unused images, reducing repo bloat.
# Below we have the sensible defaults for most use cases.
# minSize = 320
# maxSize = 1920
